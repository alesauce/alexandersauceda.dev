# Overview
Hello, and welcome to my first blog post! As I mentioned in my headline and bio, I have a lot of interests and hobbies, so the topics of my blog posts may jump around a bit. Today's post is about taking "smart notes", a concept I learned about from reading the book ["How to take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking" by SÃ¶nke Ahrens](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B09V5M8FR5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o01?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I am particularly focusing on the application of smart notes in the world of engineering.

# Why does this matter?
If there is one thing I've learned from the years I've spent in the tech field, it's that very few people know as much as you think they do. Everyone is constantly learning and figuring things out as they go.

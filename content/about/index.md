## Who Am I?
As you can probably tell from the domain or the home page, my name is Alexander. I am currently living near Denver, CO.

I'm currently working as a Systems Engineer with a focus on cloud infrastructure and evangelizing best practices. Outside of work I am currently delving into Linux server administration and Site Reliability Engineering. Recently I built a five node Raspberry Pi cluster and utilized Sake (an open-source configuration management tool written in Go) to automate my configuration management. After building the cluster I used Docker containers to deploy Portainer (a container management tool) and PiHole, a custom DNS server for network-wide ad blocking. Currently, I am working on contributions to the Sake project to improve managing server inventory. Another project of mine is working towards a stateless configuration for my personal machines by using Chezmoi to manage my personal configuration files. I don't know how, but I became one of those people who logs off from their engineering job and boots up their personal computer to work on some engineering projects. :smile:

Outside of the engineering world, I am passionate about the worlds of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) and personal productivity improvements. I'm currently reading [How to Take Smart Notes](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B09V5M8FR5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [Building a Second Brain](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B09LVVN9L3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), and between those two and [Mark Forster's work](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LLIJ3CQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), I am implementing changes to my workflow to produce more useful project ouputs.

When I do decide to have fun, I love to get outside and go bouldering or hiking, particularly to any sort of water feature. Alternatively, I love to cook and play bartender and experiment with different food and cocktail pairings. Finally, I love to read fantasy novels. A friend got me hooked on Brandon Sanderson, and one massive Kickstarter later, I'm officially buckled in and committed for life.

If any of these topics interest you, feel free to check out my blog and reach out any time! I hope you enjoy the content.

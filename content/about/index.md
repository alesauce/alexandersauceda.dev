# :wave: Howdy, howdy!

As you can probably tell from the domain or the home page, my name is Alexander. I am currently living near Denver, CO.

I'm currently working as a Systems Engineer with a focus on cloud infrastructure and evangelizing best practices. Outside of work I am currently delving into Linux server administration and Site Reliability Engineering. Recently I built a five node Raspberry Pi cluster and utilized Sake (an open-source configuration management tool written in Go) to automate my configuration management. After building the cluster I used Docker containers to deploy Portainer (a container management tool) and PiHole, a custom DNS server for network-wide ad blocking. Currently, I am working on contributions to the Sake project to improve managing server inventory. Another project of mine is working towards a stateless configuration for my personal machines by using Chezmoi to manage my personal configuration files. I don't know how, but I became one of those people who logs off from their engineering job and boots up their personal computer to work on some engineering projects. :smile:

Outside of the engineering world, I am passionate about the worlds of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) and personal productivity improvements. I'm currently reading [How to Take Smart Notes](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B09V5M8FR5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [Building a Second Brain](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B09LVVN9L3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), and between those two and [Mark Forster's work](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LLIJ3CQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), I am implementing changes to my workflow to produce more useful project ouputs.

When I do decide to have fun, I love to get outside and go bouldering or hiking, particularly to any sort of water feature. Alternatively, I love to cook and play bartender and experiment with different food and cocktail pairings. Finally, I love to read fantasy novels. A friend got me hooked on Brandon Sanderson, and one massive Kickstarter later, I'm officially buckled in and committed for life.

If any of these topics interest you, feel free to check out my blog and reach out any time! I hope you enjoy the content.

# TODO: Make new title

As you can probably tell from the domain or the home page, my name is Alexander. I am a born tinkerer, (analyzer?) and [word for someone who constantly seeks new knowledge.] I'm also a bit of a history buff, if you can't tell from the website title. I don't know how, but I became one of those people who logs off from their engineering job and boots up their personal computer to work on some engineering projects. :smile:

Throughout high school and my first two years of college, I was dead set on becoming a lawyer. However, there was always a part of me that was enthralled by the tech world because of the infinite learning possibilities and the power to create new things. I switched my major to Information Sciences, then joined Amazon after graduation as an Area Manager. (Something about enjoying arguing?) After three years as an Area Manager, I transitioned to a program manager role with the Supply Chain Execution team. I rediscovered my love of automation after my first month of manually downloading datasets and formatting them in Excel for analysis. I taught myself SQL and advanced Excel formulas to eliminate much of my team's toil stemming from manual report generation. This experience galvanized me and led me to seek roles as a Support Engineer with Amazon Explore, then as a Systems Engineer with Amazon Photos.

At the heart of my love of tech is the ability to constantly learn new skills and create new tools and woorkflows to automate tasks. My dream is to only ever do manual tasks once, then let the machines take it from there. I have grown along

part I want to emulate from readwise article that is really solid:
```
I jumped right into Python on my flight back to Australia. Soon, I was automating my own things. I made a bot to book classes at the gym, one to send weekly reports to my boss and I even made one to like my girlfriend's content on Instagram. Unfortunately, that is as far as it went. Shortly after, I got promoted. So, I had less time to learn and I let programming fall by the wayside.
```

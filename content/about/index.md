As you can probably tell from the home page, my name is Alexander. I am a born tinkerer, analyzer, and lifelong learner who loves the challenge of building things with code. I don't know how, but I became one of those people who logs off from their engineering job and boots up their personal computer to work on some engineering projects. :smile:

Throughout high school and my first two years of college, I was dead set on becoming a lawyer. However, there was always a part of me that was enthralled by the tech world because of the infinite learning possibilities and the power to create new things. I changed my major a few times in college before settling on Information Science. After college, I got a job with Amazon as an Area Manager in Fulfillment. After three years as an Area Manager, I transitioned to a Program Manager role with the Supply Chain Execution team.

I rediscovered my love of automation after my first month of manually generating reports from downloaded datasets formatted in Excel. SQL and Excel became my favored companions as I sought to reduce all of my team's toil stemming from manual report generation. My dive into the world of automation reignited my passion for all things technical, leading me to take on a role as a Support Engineer with Amazon Explore. Using the skills I learned as a Support Engineer, I transitioned into a new role as Systems Engineer with Amazon Photos, where I am as of writing.

My most important realization since working as an engineer is that the only limit to "things left to learn" is someone's time and desire. This is also at the heart of my love for the tech world - there is always something new to learn, some new way to stretch my abilities. The fire to learn has aided my growth as a developer, pushing me to partner with senior developers to improve my code and understand more of the *why* behind our design and implementation decisions, and not just the *how* to execute.

I am now seeking a role as a full-time developer where I can contribute my engineering skills and continue to expand my skillset.

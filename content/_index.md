I'm a self-taught engineer with interests in Raspberry Pis, homelabs, cloud computing, Brazilian jiu jitsu, bouldering, reading, and writing. There would probably be more interests on that list if I had unlimited time and money. Follow along as I take you through some of the ~~rabbit holes~~ learning journeys I venture on!
